This thesis explores the baryonic specific angular momentum–mass–gas fraction $(j_{\mathrm{bar}} - M_{\mathrm{bar}} - f_{\mathrm{gas}})$ relation in spiral galaxies and investigates how different star formation laws (including the classical Kennicutt–Schmidt law and a version of the Boissier law) affect it.

A semi-analytical model is developed that:
1. **Assumes inside-out growth** — gas accretes at larger radii over time.
2. **Implements various star formation laws** fitted to observational data, capturing both high-density (inner) and low-density (outer) regions of galactic disks.
3. **Keeps rotation velocity fixed in time**, to avoid artificially adding angular momentum, while allowing it to vary with radius according to a simple exponential function.

**Key results** show that:
- The *inside-out accretion* assumption is crucial for reproducing the observed $(j_{\mathrm{bar}} - M_{\mathrm{bar}} - f_{\mathrm{gas}})$ relation.
- Different star formation laws yield noticeable differences in **radial profiles** of gas and stars but do **not** dramatically change the overall $(j_{\mathrm{bar}} - M_{\mathrm{bar}} - f_{\mathrm{gas}})$ relation.
- Revised laws provide a better match to observed surface densities in galaxy outskirts compared to the classical Kennicutt–Schmidt law.
